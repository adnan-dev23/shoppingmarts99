## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1.  **Download or Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/shoppingmarts99.git](https://github.com/your-username/shoppingmarts99.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd shoppingmarts99
    ```

3.  **Run with a Live Server:**
    Because this project uses JavaScript Modules and a Service Worker for PWA features, you cannot run it by just double-clicking the `index.html` file. You need a local server.
    * If you are using **Visual Studio Code**, install the **"Live Server"** extension.
    * Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
